# simple-stock-classifier
This project shall explore the steps involved in building a stock recommendation classifier.

Motivation: I selected this project because mastering the stock market is an age-old question whose answering is saught after by many. This project will try to use a supervised ML model to predict whether the stock will go up or down in any given day.

*Dislaimer: This model should not be used as trading or investment advice. All investments are subject to market risks and investments should be made considering the said risks. This is for educational purposes only*

Libraries used in the project:
  pandas==1.0.1
  numpy==1.18.1
  matplotlib==3.1.3
  seaborn==0.10.0
  yahoofinancials==1.5
  scikit-learn==0.22.1

Files Description: This project include stock_recommendation_classifier notebook which details all the codes and analysis done to build the classifier
Results: We saw that there was some alpha in using ML models in your investment management process.
